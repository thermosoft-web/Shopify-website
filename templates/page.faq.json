One of the biggest differences you should be aware of is that electric radiant heat has a longer warmup process. Forced air heat superheats the air and pumps in hot air to your home which can create a quick change in temperature. While this time delay for feeling the effects of radiant heat is something to keep in mind, it is important to recognize that electric radiant heat will not dry out your air, nor will it waste money and energy by filling the space near the ceiling with hot air and struggling to keep the lower portions of the room warm enough.</p>"

The most important is how many BTU’s are put out by the total sum area of your heated floors.  Frequently, our radiant heating is plenty powerful to function as the primary source of heat in a home.</p><p>In most cases, it is possible to make radiant heat a sole source of heat, however, certain municipalities do not allow this.</p><p>Keep in mind that for an area like a sunroom, electric radiant heat makes a chilly space more useable and comfortable when traditional HVAC isn’t required and would be costly to run! However, if using radiant heat as a sole source of heat is prevented by building codes you should remember that the use of electric radiant heat as a supplemental heat source will often still result in a savings on your heating costs, because an electric radiant heat has higher efficiency and is a zero maintenance system.</p>"

A key point we like to remind folks of is that none of our systems have failed due to “old age” and have no moving parts and therefore require no regular maintenance. Truly, once properly installed and left undisturbed (not damaged by a careless remodeler or improperly wired) our systems should last indefinitely.

            "text": "<p>We can help! Some of the terms or phrases we use when talking about radiant heat may be new to homeowners or even new to remodeling professionals that haven’t dealt with floor heat in the past.  We will try to give some working definitions here, but please remember to give us a call if you think that you still aren’t certain about what you are planning for your radiant floor heating.</p><ul><li><strong>FiberThermics - </strong>Our patented heating technology, exclusively available from ThermoSoft. FiberThermics heating elements are extremely flexible, durable, safe and non-combustible, conductive fibers that power our most unique products.</li><li><strong>Watts per square foot - </strong>Also known as watt density or heat density, this is a measure of the amount of heating power that a radiant heat system applies per square foot. More is not always better; we specifically tailor each of our systems to be safe for the intended floor coverings and save you money with optimal energy use.</li><li><strong>Lead wires - </strong>Also referred to as cold lead wires, these are basic insulated copper wires that connect the floor heating system to the floor heating thermostat. These do not produce heat, and can be extended or shortened by your electrician, unlike the heating cables.</li><li><strong>Floor sensor - </strong>A small sensor component that is placed under your floor covering providing your floor heating thermostat with accurate and precise data regarding your floor's temperature. This is a vital element to control your floor heating system properly.</li><li><strong>Backup floor sensor - </strong>The Backup Sensor is installed in the floor just like the primary sensor. If your primary sensor should fail, connecting the backup is easy and inexpensive.</li><li><strong>Embedded - </strong>In the flooring industry, this refers to a heating system that is installed fully immersed in some sort of mortar, thinset, self leveler, or other cementatious non-combustible material.</li><li><strong>Non-embedded - </strong>This refers to a heating system that sits between the subfloor and the floor covering, not within a cementatious material. Examples would be a nail down, glue down, or floating floor application. Compatible heat systems include ThermoSoft's ThermoFloor, ThermoFilm, or WarmStep heating systems.</li><li><strong>GFCI - </strong>The ground-fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI, is a fast-acting circuit breaker designed to shut off electric power in the event of a ground-fault within as little as 1/40 of a second. It works by comparing the amount of current going to and returning from equipment along the circuit conductors.</li><li><strong>Line voltage - </strong>Line voltage is the standard voltage that’s found in outlets and junction boxes in the United States and Canada. Line voltage is either 120- or 240-Volt in most residential buildings.</li><li><strong>Low voltage - </strong>Low voltage most commonly refers to the main voltages as used by domestic and light industrial and commercial consumers.</li><li><strong>Parallel vs series wiring - </strong>The method of connecting multiple electrical components together to connect them to a single voltage, or power source. It is important to only connect our heaters in parallel, as their performance is reliant on equal distribution of power and operating at their intended resistances.</li><li><strong>Fiberglass mesh - </strong>Typically used in any floor installation that needs additional structural stability, our ThemoTile Mats are built with heavy duty construction grade fiberglass mesh as an anti-fracture layer.</li><li><strong>Uncoupling membrane - </strong>Membranes such as DITRA Heat, Prodessa, or Prova provide a structural break between the subfloor and a tile floor covering, adding durability and longevity to the tile and grout used. Uncoupling membranes that we offer also aid you in spacing out the heating cable precisely.</li><li><strong>Underlayment - </strong>Usually a pad or other flexible material used between a subfloor and a floor covering to provide benefits like sound isolation, softening impact under floating floors, moisture control, or a combination of those and other benefits.</li><li><strong>Resistance reading - </strong>This is a measurement of the electrical resistance provided through an electrical circuit or component. Each heating system from ThermoSoft will come with labels indicating a factory tested resistance range which you should measure, verify, and record these values before, during, and after your installation to ensure that your heating system has not been damaged during shipment or installation.</li><li><strong>Floating floor - </strong>Refers to a flooring installation in which the floor covering is not directly attached to the subfloor. Such installation usually includes an uderlayment between the subfloor and the flooring material. ThermoFloor is an all-in-one heater and underlayment, and WarmStep is a heating system that pairs perfectly with any underlayment. Both of these heating systems are excellent options for a floating floor.</li><li><strong>Glue down - </strong>Wood flooring is frequently installed with a wood flooring-specific adhesive. This is a popular option because a glue down application works with any subfloor, provides a better hold for wider plank wood floors versus nail down installation, and can provide sound and moisture control properties to a wood floor.</li><li><strong>Nail down - </strong>The most traditional method of wood flooring installation, nail down can refer to using a variety of fasteners such as nails, cleats, or staples driven through the wood flooring into the subfloor. A fast and inexpensive method, nail down installation is limited by only being compatible with wooden subfloors, and not providing other benefits to the wood floor.</li></ul>"
